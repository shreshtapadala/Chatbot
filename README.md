# Chatbot

My chatbot is an AI-powered assistant designed to provide users with engaging and personalized interactions. Using the OpenAI API, my chatbot is capable of responding to a wide range of queries, from answering general questions to providing advice and engaging in casual conversation. It leverages natural language processing to understand user input and generate contextually relevant responses in real-time.

While one of its standout features is its ability to emulate the personalities and dialogue styles of the characters from the Friends TV show. It incorporates the humor and personalities of the main characters from the Friends TV show (Joey, Chandler, Monica, Rachel, Ross, and Phoebe) making interactions with the chatbot fun and enjoyable for fans of the series.
